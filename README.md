# liri-node-app

## Purpose
This is a class project to demonstrate my skills with using node to call APIs. 

## Overview
This repository utilizes node to take in command line arguments and return data from either Twitter, Spotify, or OMDB. Returned data will be printed to the console and append to log.txt.

Legal commands are as follows:

node liri.js my-tweets
node liri.js spotify-this-song [song title of user choice]
node liri.js movie-this [movie title of user choice]
node liri.js do-what-it-says
